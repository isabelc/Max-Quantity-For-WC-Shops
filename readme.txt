Set a limit for the max quantity of products that can be added to cart, per product, per order. Now with individual product limits.

== Description ==

= Requires WooCommerce 3.0 or above. =

Max Quantity For WC Shops is a simple extension for WooCommerce that only does one thing: it lets you set a max limit for the number of items that can be added to the cart, for each product, per order.

It's like one of those signs at the grocery store that says, "LIMIT 2 PER CUSTOMER!" This plugin will not add a sign like that, but the quantity input field (pictured above) will hit a limit.

You can simply set a universal limit to affect all products in your WooCommerce store. If you prefer, you can set a different limit for each product, individually. Each product's own limit will always override the universal limit.

This works for all products in your WooCommerce store: Simple and Variable products. 

Customers do not have to be logged in for this to work. This works for guest buyers, as well as logged-in buyers.

== Installation ==

**Install and Activate**

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins –> Add New.
2. Search for "Max Quantity For WC Shops" to find the plugin.
3. When you see "Max Quantity For WC Shops", click "Install Now" to install the plugin.
4. Click "Activate" to activate the plugin.

**Configure**

The plugin only has 2 settings. You can use these settings in a variety of ways to accomplish the unique goals of your store. See the documentation for specific ways to use these settings:

1. To set a universal limit to affect all products, go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products tab. Click "Inventory". Scroll down to "Maximum Quantity Limit Per Product". Set your desired limit there.
2. To set an individual product limit for a single product, go the product's own "Edit product" page. Scroll down to the "Product Data" box. Click on the Inventory tab. There, you’ll see the setting called, "Max Quantity Per Order." Set your desired max limit for that product, there.
