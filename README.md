WooCommerce Max Quantity
========================

Set a universal limit for the max quantity, per product, that can be added to cart. Does not require customers to log in.

WooCommerce Max Quantity is an extremely simple extension for [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) that lets you set a max limit for the number of items that can be added to the cart. It's simple because there is only 1 option (your desired maximum number). It's a universal limit, meaning this limit affects each product in your WooCommerce store.

**NOTE:**
This plugin only works with "Simple" products. For products that have "variations", you can try [this fork by thekillerdev](https://github.com/thekillerdev/WooCommerce-Max-Quantity) instead, which he modified to work with products with variations.
**END NOTE**

The limit is per product, not per the entire cart. 

This works for guest buyers, as well as logged-in buyers.

To set the number, go to your WordPress dashboard. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products tab. Click on "Inventory". Scroll down to "Maximum Quantity Limit Per Product". Set your desired limit there.
